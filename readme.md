- Solving Problems from Leet code
- Avoid using var because it has function scope, which can lead to unintended variable hoisting and global pollution.
- Use let instead, as it has block scope and reduces the risk of unintended variable access.
- In Sorted Question always remember to go from 0 to N and in binary search for insert
- In 2d matrix in binary remember about row and col -> row = middle / 2 and col = middle % 2 and every other pattern is same we just change the search in given matrix pattern matrix[row][col] ;
